# Context

#### _[January 2nd 2174]_

You know the history books, but they are mostly blank pages. The world we are trying to study, _Earth_, was fine until the **Global Conflict of 2080** happened. That massive war totally destroyed the planet, made it completely unviable, and forced all surviving civilization to pack up and leave in huge spacecraft vessels. Nothing from this ancient, moderned and highly developed civilization, called Humans, survived the disaster.

So now, here we are in 2174, and we still have a giant hole in our understanding of what actually led up to that collapse, and more generally of the life of this civilization in Earth almost 100 years ago. That's where you come in.

As an **Intern in Earth History**, you have been designated to participate to the huge project to reconstruct Earth’s past. Your specific mission is to **reconstruct the history of the volatile 2014–2017 era**. You need to figure out how that advanced society broke down.

### The Archive: The Single Surviving Fragment

The unique and most important artifact we recovered from the crash is the [**Reddit Hyperlink Network**](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html). Think of it: millions of digital interactions preserved! It's the single surviving fragment of human communication from those critical years. Everything else is lost.

You are now looking at the archive. Your first task in this mission is to figure out if this data is even usable. 

**The Problem**: When you open the file, it’s a chaotic mess. It looks like an ancient, dead language. Why? Because the original text of the posts is too corrupted to recover. It just tracks connections between thousands of subreddits which were their digital communities. You're probably thinking the same thing: _If the text is corrupted, how can we tell what happened in those years?_

But don't let the language barrier scare you off. The core emotions-the anger, the sadness, the joy-are universal. Your entire mission is based on analyzing the **network's relationships** and the **emotional scores** as they are the only tool we have left to understand what happened.

### Deciphering the Code

You don't need a text translator. You just need to focus on two things: the relationships (who linked to whom) and the emotion (±1 score).

The first job is to build an Emotional Translation ...
